# Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree
## PID Control Project 

### Overview

This is a project for Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree. The objective of this project is to implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around a race track in a simulated environment. The simulator will provide the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle and throttle.
